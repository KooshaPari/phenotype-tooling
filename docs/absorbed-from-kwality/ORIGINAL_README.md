# Kwality

**LLM Validation & Quality Assurance Platform** — An archived experimental framework for AI code validation, test quality assessment, and knowledge graph-based requirements tracing using DeepEval, Playwright MCP, and Neo4j.

> **⚠️ ARCHIVED** — This project is preserved for historical and research reference only. Do not delete or unarchive without explicit authorization. Not maintained; use Phenotype ecosystem tooling for current quality assurance and validation work.

## Overview

Kwality was an exploratory project investigating automated AI code validation and LLM-based quality assurance. It pioneered several techniques now adopted across the Phenotype ecosystem:

- **AI Test Evaluation** — DeepEval framework for assessing test quality, coverage, and effectiveness
- **Browser Automation MCP** — Playwright integration as an MCP tool for automated UI testing
- **Knowledge Graphs** — Neo4j-based requirement tracing and test coverage mapping

While the project itself is archived, concepts from Kwality influenced production systems in the Phenotype ecosystem.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **LLM Framework**: DeepEval (for test evaluation)
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright + Playwright MCP
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j (for requirement tracing)
- **API**: FastAPI (if API server was present)

## Original Purpose

Kwality explored three key research areas:

1. **AI-Driven Test Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluate test cases for comprehensiveness
   - Measure test coverage semantically (not just line coverage)
   - Suggest test improvements using LLMs

2. **Browser Automation via MCP**
   - Playwright as an MCP server tool
   - UI testing through language models
   - Visual assertion validation

3. **Semantic Requirement Tracing**
   - Neo4j knowledge graphs for FR mapping
   - Trace code <-> tests <-> requirements
   - Identify coverage gaps via graph queries

## Key Insights (Research Outputs)

- **DeepEval Integration**: Validated that LLMs can effectively assess test quality beyond syntax
- **MCP Browser Tool**: Demonstrated feasibility of Playwright-as-a-service via MCP protocol
- **Knowledge Graphs for Tracing**: Graph-based traceability outperforms string matching for FR coverage

These insights have been incorporated into:
- **Benchora** — FR traceability and validation framework (successor)
- **phenotype-shared** — Shared testing utilities and frameworks
- **PhenoObservability** — Knowledge graph-based observability
- **Tracera** — Distributed tracing with Neo4j backend

```

## Why It Was Archived

1. **Resource Allocation**: Shifted focus to production systems (Benchora, Tracera)
2. **Complexity**: DeepEval + Neo4j + Playwright MCP proved overkill for initial use cases
3. **Maintainability**: No ongoing maintenance resources for experimental projects
4. **Consolidation**: FR traceability moved to Benchora, test evaluation to phenotype-shared

## Migration Path (For Related Work)

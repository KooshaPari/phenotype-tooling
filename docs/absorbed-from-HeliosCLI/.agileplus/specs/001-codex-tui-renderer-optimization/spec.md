# Feature Specification: Codex TUI Renderer Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `001-codex-tui-renderer-optimization`  
**Created**: 2026-02-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Mission**: research

## Summary
Produce a research-grade architecture walkthrough of the current Codex TUI renderer and its backend event/runtime architecture, then define a layered optimization roadmap informed by octorus and Rust TUI performance practices.

## Problem Statement
Current renderer and backend behavior are distributed across multiple modules, making it hard to reason about frame scheduling, event flow, and optimization leverage points. This blocks reliable prioritization for high-impact performance work.

## Goals
- Deliver an architecture walkthrough for current TUI rendering and backend event flow.
- Provide ASCII diagrams that can be used directly in planning and PR discussions.
- Produce optimization research grounded in concrete evidence and source tracking.
- Define a layered PR strategy that can be executed incrementally with clear outcomes.

## Non-Goals
- Implementing renderer changes in this feature.
- Executing benchmark harness changes in this feature.
- Merging any runtime refactor in this feature.

## Actors
- CLI maintainers prioritizing performance work.
- Agent implementers executing follow-on layered PRs.
- Reviewers validating architecture and optimization rationale.

## User Scenarios & Testing
### Primary Scenario
A maintainer needs a trusted architecture baseline and optimization sequence before authoring implementation PRs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the feature artifacts, maintainers can trace render lifecycle from input event to frame flush.
2. Given the backend diagram, maintainers can trace how model events become UI updates.
3. Given optimization findings, maintainers can identify phased PRs with measurable expected impact.
4. Given source logs, reviewers can audit every major claim against recorded evidence.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The feature MUST provide a current-state TUI renderer architecture walkthrough.
- **FR-002**: The feature MUST provide a current-state backend architecture walkthrough relevant to TUI rendering.
- **FR-003**: The feature MUST include ASCII diagrams for both renderer and backend flows.
- **FR-004**: The feature MUST capture optimization opportunities prioritized by expected user-visible impact.
- **FR-005**: The feature MUST include a layered PR strategy with explicit sequencing and dependency intent.
- **FR-006**: The feature MUST maintain an auditable evidence trail with source register and finding log.
- **FR-007**: The feature MUST record open questions and risks for follow-on planning.

## Success Criteria
- 100% of major architecture claims map to at least one source entry in the evidence logs.
- Maintainers can identify at least 3 independent optimization PR layers without additional discovery.
- The produced diagrams are sufficient for review discussion without requiring code navigation for basic flow understanding.
- At least 5 optimization recommendations are ranked with rationale and expected impact class.

## Key Entities
- **Renderer Path**: Ordered stages from input/event to frame scheduling and terminal flush.
- **Backend Event Path**: Ordered stages from protocol/model events to UI state updates.
- **Optimization Candidate**: A measurable improvement hypothesis with impact and risk level.
- **Layered PR Slice**: A bounded change unit in a dependency-aware sequence.
- **Evidence Entry**: A traceable source-backed finding record.

## Dependencies
- Access to current `heliosCLI` codebase paths under `codex-rs/`.
- Public references for Rust TUI optimization practices.

## Assumptions
- Target branch for follow-on execution is `main`.
- This feature remains research-only and does not include code behavior changes.
- Layered PR execution will be performed in a later implementation phase.

## Risks
- Architecture drift if code changes significantly before follow-on PRs begin.
- Overfitting recommendations to one workload profile without benchmark baselines.

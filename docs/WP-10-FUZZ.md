# WP-10: Fuzz CI nightly — rescue the invariant-enforcement story

> Status: landed (2026-06-29)
> Branch: `hygiene/phase3-wp06-deps-triage`
> Crate: `crates/fuzz-setup`
> Workflow: `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`

## Why

Post-WP-05, `phenotype-cli` started enforcing invariants on the absorbed
content (audit-chain signatures, canonical JSON serialization of
governance yaml, IR hash stability across reorders, Starlark parser
invariants). Manual PBT runs during merge weeks caught **two
serialization regressions** in `release-cut` and one `serde_yaml`
canonicalisation drift in `docs-health`. Coverage was left to
**memory + hand-curated seeds**, which is exactly the failure mode
that fuzzy testing was invented to catch.

WP-10 replaces those manual seeds with a CI fuzz battalion that runs
nightly, archives crashes, and gates PRs on a one-shot pass.

## What was built

### 1. The harnesses — `crates/fuzz-setup/fuzz_targets/{*.rs}`

| Harness                  | Function                                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `audit_chain_verify.rs`  | Adversarial JSON for audit-chain verify path: structural valid + chain signature reverify path |
| `canonical_json.rs`      | Round-trip canonicalization via `serde_json`     |
| `ir_hash_stability.rs`   | IR serialization/rederivation hash stability     |
| `starlark_parse_invariants.rs` | Starlark script AST parser invariants           |

Each target uses `libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target!` (no_main) with structural
asserts — so failure is encoded as a crash, not just a log. Harness
selection follows the **invariant → harness** contract from the
Absorption Rubric: every invariant the production code enforces must
have a fuzzer-corpus front-line.

### 2. The workflow — `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`

```yaml
on:
  schedule:           # nightly fuzz battalion
    - cron: '0 4 * * *'   # 04:00 UTC;  burns 10 minutes
  push:               # PR-time gate, fast pass
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:  # ad-hoc burst runs
    inputs:
      duration: { default: '60' }   # seconds; cap 60
```

The job uses:
- **`rust:nightly`** (only nightly has the unstable `-Z` flags
  honggfuzz + libfuzzer-target tracing depend on).
- **`actions/cache`** on the `fuzz/` corpus directory — every run
  inherits last night's corpus and feeds back fresh entries.
- **`actions/upload-artifact`** for crash + corpus snapshots.
- A **named concurrency group** so multiple pushes don't fight over the
  nightly's `target/`.
- A **failure-summary step** that posts the failing input back as a
  PR comment via `$GITHUB_TOKEN` via `gh`.

### 3. The contract

- **Coverage gate**: every new invariant added to absorbed crates ships
  with a fuzz harness in the same PR; CI fails release-cut until parity
  is restored.
- **Backpressure**: a true positive crash in any harness halts the
  nightly's down-stream jobs (`bench`, `ci-deps-triage`) — by design.
  Crash triage owns the crash before any non-fuzz pipeline resumes.
- **No retries**: the harness uses `arbitrary` to be deterministic on
  recorded seeds. Crash input is the kanban root.

### 4. Acceptance criteria
1. Nightly cron runs the harnesses at 04:00 UTC ✓
2. PR-time gate runs `-rss_limit_mb=1024` for 30 s per target ✓
3. Crash archives are routed to `actions/cache` (corpus) +
   `actions/upload-artifact` (artefacts), 7-day retention ✓
4. New invariants in absorbed crates trigger a JIRA failure if no
   harness exists; documented in `docs/WP-10-FUZZ.md` (this file) ✓

## Operational notes

- **Run-time budget**: a 60 s fuzz pass per harness finds all
  regressions we observed during absorption. Nightly 600 s budget finds
  path-coverage gaps faster than hand curation.
- **Where it does NOT live**: rebase branches of absorbed sub-crate
  work. Only the consolidated workspace runs fuzz CI; PRs to absorbed
  sub-crates are integration-tested via WP-06 ledger and CI on their
  own forks.

## Pending deferred items

- Front-end fuzz banner UI: out of scope (intentional backend-only).
- AFL++ integration: deferred to Phase 4 once a real corpus > 1.5k
  inputs justifies it.

## Acceptance signature

Pre-merge verification checklist (cargo test):
```
[ ] cargo test -p fuzz-setup --release passes
[ ] each fuzz_target aborts on panic via `cargo fuzz run target`; documented in WP-10-FUZZ.md
[ ] nightly cron present, manual_dispatch path documented
```

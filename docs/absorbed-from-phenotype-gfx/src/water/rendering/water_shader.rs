//! `WaterShader` — pass-through name-only handle.
//!
//! Deprecated: the C# `WaterShader` wrapped a Unity `Shader` instance loaded
//! via `Shader.Find`. In the single Rust core the shader is just a name; the
//! engine-side binding is the consumer's responsibility. Kept as a struct so
//! the C# edge (and the registry tests) can still pass a stable identity
//! through the port.

/// Thin pass-through for a Unity shader name. Deprecated; consumers should
/// rely on the engine-side shader lookup at render time.

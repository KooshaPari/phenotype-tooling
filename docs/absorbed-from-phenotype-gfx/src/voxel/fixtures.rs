//! Reusable test fixtures for [`DirtyChunkEvent`] ordering and replay.
//!
//! These fixtures codify the event-order matrix described in
//! `specs/dirty-chunk-ordering-fixure.md`.  They are exported (under
//! `pub mod fixtures`) so downstream consumers (Civis, WorldSphereMod3D, and
//! future game integrations) can pin the same input vectors in their own
//! integration tests instead of hand-rolling matrices that drift over time.
//!
//! Three families are exposed:
//!
//! * [`sample_sequence`] — a single, well-known write sequence that mixes
//!   chunks and sequence numbers; used to assert `(chunk_id, write_seq)`
//!   sort order is stable.
//! * [`sample_with_ties`] — a sequence containing two events with identical
//!   `(chunk_id, write_seq)` values; consumers must treat these as a no-op
//!   and not double-rebuild the chunk.
//! * [`sample_lod_transition`] — a sequence that interleaves writes from
//!   two adjacent LOD levels on the same chunk; ordering must be preserved
//!   across the transition so LOD demotion/promotion does not desync
//!   rebuild order.

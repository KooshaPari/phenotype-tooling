# ADR-003: Spec-Driven Development via AgilePlus

## Status

**Accepted** - 2024-03-01

## Context

The Phenotype ecosystem has grown to multiple repositories with varying development practices. We need a consistent methodology for:
- Feature development workflow
- Requirements documentation
- Implementation planning
- Quality assurance

## Decision

We will adopt **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** using the **AgilePlus** methodology and tooling.

### Key Aspects

1. **Specifications first**: Write specs before implementation
2. **kitty-spec format**: Standardized specification template
3. **Git worktrees**: Feature branch isolation
4. **Traceability**: Link requirements to code
5. **Validation**: Automated spec compliance checking

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear requirements before coding begins
- Better estimation and planning
- Consistent documentation across teams
- Enables traceability from requirements to code
- Reduces rework from misunderstood requirements

### Negative

- Additional upfront documentation time
- Learning curve for new methodology
- Tooling dependencies

### Mitigations

1. **Templates**: Use kitty-spec templates to reduce boilerplate
2. **Training**: Team sessions on SDD workflow
3. **Tooling**: Invest in spec-links and validation tools
4. **Gradual adoption**: Start with critical features

## Unique Value Proposition

Agent Wave aims to provide:

1. **Wave-Based Execution**: Coordinated parallel execution of agent tasks in "waves"
2. **Lifecycle Management**: Standardized startup, health, and shutdown for agents
3. **Phenotype Integration**: Part of the Phenotype ecosystem with MCP and AgentAPI++ integration
4. **Policy Federation**: Integration with agentops-policy-federation for governance

## Comparison to Similar Projects

### vs LangGraph

LangGraph is production-grade but:
- Complex DAG-based model may be overkill for simple workflows
- Python-only
- No wave-based concept
- No native lifecycle management

Agent Wave provides simpler wave-based model with lifecycle awareness.

### vs AutoGen

AutoGen is Microsoft-backed but:
- Conversational model doesn't fit batch orchestration
- No health/shutdown concepts
- Complex agent definitions

Agent Wave focuses on batch/orchestration use cases.

### vs CrewAI

CrewAI is popular but:
- Role-based, not wave-based
- No lifecycle management
- Python-only

Agent Wave provides wave-based coordination.

## Ecosystem Position

Agent Wave fits in the Phenotype ecosystem:

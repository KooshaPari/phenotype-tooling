# Guardis Charter

## Mission Statement

Guardis provides a comprehensive security platform that enables organizations to identify, monitor, and remediate security vulnerabilities across their entire software development lifecycle—from code commit to production deployment.

Our mission is to make enterprise-grade security accessible to teams of all sizes by providing automated, intelligent security scanning that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows and provides actionable remediation guidance.

## Tenets (unless you know better ones)

These tenets guide the security scanning, vulnerability detection, and remediation philosophy:

### 1. Shift Left by Default

Security scanning happens at commit time, not deploy time. Issues are caught in IDE, caught in CI, prevented from reaching production.

- **Rationale**: Earlier detection is cheaper
- **Implication**: Developer-first tooling
- **Trade-off**: Developer friction for prevention

### 2. Actionable Over Comprehensive**

10 actionable findings beat 100 theoretical issues. Each alert includes severity, impact, and fix guidance. No alert fatigue.

- **Rationale**: Unactionable findings are ignored
- **Implication**: Prioritization and context
- **Trade-off**: Scope for actionability

### 3. Context-Aware Scanning**

A vulnerability in a demo app differs from production. Context (environment, data sensitivity, exposure) modifies severity.

- **Rationale**: Not all code is equally critical
- **Implication**: Contextual risk scoring
- **Trade-off**: Complexity for accuracy

### 4. Continuous, Not Point-in-Time**

Security is continuous monitoring, not annual audits. New vulnerabilities trigger alerts. Drift detection is automatic.

- **Rationale**: Threats evolve continuously
- **Implication**: Continuous scanning infrastructure
- **Trade-off**: Compute for vigilance

### 5. Privacy-Preserving**

Source code analysis happens locally or in customer-controlled environments. No code leaves customer control without explicit consent.

- **Rationale**: Code is intellectual property
- **Implication**: Local-first architecture
- **Trade-off**: Architecture constraints for trust

### 6. Compliance as Code**

Compliance requirements (SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.) are encoded as scan rules. Compliance is automated verification, not manual checkbox.

- **Rationale**: Compliance requires evidence
- **Implication**: Compliance rule packs
- **Trade-off**: Maintenance for assurance

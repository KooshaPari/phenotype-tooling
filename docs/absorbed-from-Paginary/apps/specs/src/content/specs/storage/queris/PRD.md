# Product Requirements Document — Queris

**Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: Active Development  
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-05

---

## Overview

Queris is a **state-of-the-art database abstraction layer** for the Phenotype ecosystem, providing type-safe, async-first database access with compile-time SQL verification, multi-backend support, and enterprise-grade connection management. It wraps established Rust database libraries (sqlx, deadpool) to provide a consistent interface across all Phenotype services.

### What Queris Is

- **Query Builder**: Fluent, type-safe SQL query construction
- **Connection Pool Manager**: High-performance async connection pooling
- **Migration System**: Embedded SQL migrations with checksum verification
- **Multi-Backend Abstraction**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite support
- **Query Optimizer**: Plan caching and result streaming

### What Queris Is Not

- Not a full ORM (raw SQL is first-class)
- Not synchronous (async-only)
- Not replacing sqlx (wraps and extends it)

---

## Problem Statement

Phenotype Rust services each implement database connection pooling, migration running, and query error mapping independently. This leads to:

1. **Code Duplication**: Each service re-implements the same patterns
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error types across services
3. **Connection Management Issues**: Improper pool sizing, missing health checks
4. **Migration Chaos**: Each project has custom migration tooling
5. **Testing Complexity**: No unified test utilities

Queris centralizes these concerns so all services share a single, well-tested implementation.

## Goals

| Goal | Description | Success Metric |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Type Safety | Compile-time SQL verification | Zero runtime SQL errors |
| Performance | Sub-5ms p99 latency | Benchmark verified |
| Developer Experience | Ergonomic Rust API | Developer satisfaction |
| Multi-Backend | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite | All supported |
| Observability | Metrics, tracing, logging | Full integration |

---

## Non-Goals

- **Full ORM support**: Raw SQL is first-class; Queris does not hide SQL
- **Synchronous access**: Async-only; no blocking database calls
- **sqlx replacement**: Wraps sqlx; leverages its ecosystem
- **Migration version control**: Does not manage migration history; only runs them
- **Database creation**: Assumes database exists; does not create databases

**Example**:
```rust
let users = table!(users)
    .filter(status.eq("active"))
    .order(created_at.desc())
    .limit(10)
    .fetch_all(&pool)
    .await?;

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `Migrator::run()` applies pending migrations
- Checksums prevent tampering
- Already-applied migrations are skipped
- `Migrator::rollback()` reverts last migration

### E5 — Error Handling

**Goal**: Provide consistent, informative error types.

| E5.5 | Developer | `ConnectionFailed` variant | I know when DB is unreachable |

**Error Variants**:
```rust
pub enum QuerisError {
    ConnectionFailed { source: sqlx::Error, url: String },
    PoolExhausted { max_size: u32, wait_time: Duration },
    QueryFailed { sql: String, source: sqlx::Error },

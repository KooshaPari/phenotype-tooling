## WP-001: Catalog All 19 Private Repos — Map Functionality and Dependencies

- **State:** planned
- **Sequence:** 1
- **File Scope:** 19 private repositories (template-lang-go, template-commons, Schemaforge, Flagward, phenotype-docs-engine, phenotype-evaluation, phenotype-skills, Prismal, Cursora, phenotype-patch, phenotype-sentinel, phenotype-agent-core, phenotype-vessel, phenotype-config, Parpoura, Civis, phenotype-agents, Holdr, Flowra)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Complete catalog of all 19 private repos with: name, language, purpose, owner, access controls
  - Dependency map showing relationships between private repos
  - Sensitive content inventory for each repo (credentials, keys, internal data)
  - Public equivalent mapping for each private repo
  - Catalog published as structured document (JSON + markdown)
- **Estimated Effort:** M

Conduct a comprehensive catalog of all 19 private repositories. Each repo is documented with its purpose, ownership, access controls, dependencies, and relationship to public repos. Sensitive content is inventoried for security review.

### Subtasks
- [ ] T001 Query GitHub API for all private repos with metadata (size, language, last activity)
- [ ] T002 Document each repo's purpose and functionality from README and code analysis
- [ ] T003 Identify ownership and access controls for each repo (who has access, permission levels)
- [ ] T004 Map dependencies between private repos (imports, references, shared config)
- [ ] T005 Inventory sensitive content: credentials, API keys, internal data, proprietary algorithms
- [ ] T006 Map each private repo to its public equivalent (if any)
- [ ] T007 Assess which private repos should remain private vs. candidates for public release
- [ ] T008 Produce structured catalog: JSON data file + markdown documentation
- [ ] T009 Validate catalog accuracy: cross-reference with repo owners

### Dependencies
- None (starting WP for this spec)

### Risks & Mitigations
- Access limitations: Ensure proper credentials for all private repos before starting
- Sensitive content exposure: Handle with care, document findings securely, do not log sensitive data

## WP-004: Identify Duplicates with Public Repos

- **State:** planned
- **Sequence:** 4
- **File Scope:** All 19 private repos cross-referenced with public repos
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Duplicate analysis for each private repo with public equivalent

## Dependency & Execution Summary

```
WP-001 (Catalog 19 private repos) ───────────── first, no deps
WP-002 (Complete core agent infra) ──────────── depends on WP-001
WP-003 (Complete apps/tools) ────────────────── depends on WP-001 (parallel with WP-002)
WP-004 (Identify duplicates with public) ────── depends on WP-001
WP-005 (Sync plan + governance) ─────────────── depends on WP-004
```

**Parallelization**: WP-002 and WP-003 can run in parallel (different repo sets). WP-004 can start after WP-001. WP-005 is the final step.

**MVP Scope**: WP-001 alone produces the private repo catalog. WP-004 adds duplicate analysis.

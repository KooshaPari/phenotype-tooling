# phenotype-journeys

Shared, project-agnostic **journey harness** for the Phenotype org: record a
user-facing flow (CLI tape, UI test, or Playwright trace), emit a canonical
manifest, and verify it with a Claude-describe + Claude-judge loop.

## Why this exists

Journey harness code kept accreting inside individual projects — VHS tapes +
manifest JSON in `hwLedger/apps/cli-journeys/`, XCUITest capture in
`hwLedger/apps/macos/HwLedgerUITests/`, a `JourneyViewer.vue` in the hwLedger
docs theme, a `hwledger-gui-recorder` crate. None of it was reusable. Every
new Phenotype project that wanted journeys had to re-derive the format and
the verify loop from scratch.

`phenotype-journeys` extracts those into one package:

- **Canonical manifest schema** (`schema/manifest.schema.json`) — source of
  truth for step/verification shape.
- **`phenotype-journey-core`** (Rust) — serde types, schema export, and the
  verify loop in both `mock` and `live` (Anthropic API) modes.
- **`phenotype-journey`** (Rust CLI) — `record`, `verify`, `validate`, `sync`.
- **`@phenotype/journey-viewer`** (Vue 3) — `JourneyViewer` +
  `RecordingEmbed` components for VitePress docs.
- **`@phenotype/journey-playwright`** (TypeScript) — script a web page and
  emit a conformant manifest.

## Planned consumers

- **hwLedger** — swap `apps/cli-journeys/scripts/verify-manifests.sh` +
  in-theme `JourneyViewer.vue` for this package. (See `MIGRATION.md` in the
  hwLedger repo.)
- **AgilePlus** — journeys for feature specs (one per tagged FR).
- **thegent** — journeys for plugin onboarding flows.

## Acceptance criteria

Consuming projects should fail their quality gate if a spec tagged as
user-facing does not have a corresponding passing journey manifest. Enforce
via CI:

```bash
phenotype-journey validate docs/journeys/manifests/<spec-id>/manifest.verified.json
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Record a CLI tape (wraps charmbracelet/vhs)
phenotype-journey record --tape tapes/first-plan.tape --out journeys/

# 2. Write a stub manifest (hand-authored or from journey-playwright)

# 3. Validate against the canonical schema
phenotype-journey validate journeys/manifests/first-plan/manifest.json

# 4. Verify (mock mode, offline, no API key needed)
phenotype-journey verify journeys/manifests/first-plan/manifest.json

# 5. Ship artefacts to the docs public dir
phenotype-journey sync --from journeys --to docs/public/journeys
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and pass `--live` (requires building with
`--features live`) to call real Claude for describe + judge passes.

## Ground-truth assertions (`phenotype-journey assert`)

Claude-judge alone is soft. A tape can literally display
`error: unexpected argument` and still pass if the judge hallucinates. The
`assert` subcommand adds hard gates that fail the build when frame content is
wrong.

### Dependencies

- `tesseract` CLI — install with `brew install tesseract` (macOS) or
  `apt-get install tesseract-ocr` (Debian). **No silent skip**: if tesseract
  is missing the command exits non-zero with a clear message.
- Override OCR for tests or custom pipelines via
  `PHENOTYPE_JOURNEY_OCR_CMD="my-ocr {{PATH}}"` (the `{{PATH}}` token is
  replaced with the PNG path).

### Intents YAML schema extension

Each step may carry an `assertions` block:

```yaml
journey: traceability-report
steps:
  - index: 1
    intent: "Command typed: cargo run ..."
    assertions:
      must_contain: ["cargo run", "hwledger-traceability"]
      must_not_contain: ["error:", "unexpected argument"]
      ocr_required: true
  - index: 8
    intent: "Integer row-count returned"
    assertions:
      expected_exit: 0
```

- `must_contain` — every listed substring must appear in the OCR of that
  step's keyframe.
- `must_not_contain` — none of the listed substrings may appear.
- `expected_exit` — the LAST keyframe of the journey must include the
  sentinel `__EXIT_<N>__`.
- `ocr_required` — reserved for future "OCR must succeed" gating; default
  inferred from the presence of contain/not_contain lists.

### Exit-code sentinel (canonical tape pattern)

Wrap the final command in the tape so the sentinel lands in the recording:

```vhs
Type "hwledger plan --help; echo __EXIT_$?__"
Enter
Sleep 500ms
```

This produces a visible `__EXIT_0__` (or `__EXIT_N__`) in the last frame that
`phenotype-journey assert` can OCR and gate on.

### Usage

```bash
phenotype-journey assert apps/cli-journeys/manifests/plan-deepseek/manifest.json --strict
```

With `--strict`, exits non-zero when any assertion is violated. Without, the
report prints but the process exits 0. Journeys with zero assertions print a
loud warning so they cannot hide.

# PhenoObservability — Per-Module Boundary Disposition

**Status:** Approved assessment  
**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Repo:** `KooshaPari/PhenoObservability`  
**Charter:** [`phenotype-registry/docs/rationalization/boundary-shaping.md`](https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenotype-registry/blob/main/docs/rationalization/boundary-shaping.md)  
**Audit:** [`docs/audit/BLOCK-C-AUDIT.md`](../audit/BLOCK-C-AUDIT.md)  
**Registry:** [`phenotype-registry/BOUNDARY_OWNERS.md`](https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenotype-registry/blob/main/BOUNDARY_OWNERS.md) — `observe` domain  
**Wave A:** [`docs/disposition/wave-a-absorption.md`](../disposition/wave-a-absorption.md)  
**RFC 001:** [`docs/disposition/rfc001-traceon-wave2.md`](../disposition/rfc001-traceon-wave2.md)

> **Doctrine:** Stubs and scaffolds receive an owner and a migration path — not silent deletion.
> Hard delete applies only after absorption evidence and consumer manifest scan (registry gate §5).

## 1. Summary — recommended end-state

**PhenoObservability is the canonical `observe` role workspace** — active, not a migration
source to archive away.

| Concern | Owner after disposition |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Rust tracing hexagonal core (`tracingkit`, tracely-*) | **PhenoObservability** `crates/` |
| Rust metrics (`metrickit`, phenotype-metrics) | **PhenoObservability** `crates/` + `rust/` |
| Rust logging / telemetry / health | **PhenoObservability** `rust/` + `crates/logkit` |
| Production OTLP init (thin) | **phenotype-otel** → **merge into PO** (RFC 001) |
| Python observability facade | **phenotype-python-sdk** `packages/observability-kit` |
| HexaKit observability inbound (#22, #26, #35, #39, #48, #49) | **PhenoObservability** (Wave A) |
| Go OTEL reference | **PhenoObservability** `tracing/` (edge reference) |
| TS telemetry ports | **PhenoObservability** `ports/` (edge reference) |
| Profiling harness | **PhenoObservability** `profiling/` (Profila absorption target) |
| Misplaced security aggregator | **Authvault** (decompose out) |
| Misplaced compliance scanner duplicate | **TestingKit** or `phenotype-compliance` (evaluate) |
| Domain squatters (LLM, MCP server crates) | **Removed** from workspace; dirs frozen |
| Cross-cutting vendor copies | **phenoShared** (Wave E) — delete `vendor/` after repoint |
| This repository | **KEEP ACTIVE** — org-wide observability SSOT |

**Do not** treat ObservabilityKit file parity in python-sdk as permission to shrink this
repo. Rust workspace + Wave A inbound remain unique.

## 2. Method

- Git tree `main` @ e8af398 (2026-06-17, post PR #161 RFC 001)
- Cross-repo compare: HexaKit DISPOSITION rows #22, #26, #35, #39, #48, #49; `phenotype-otel`; SDK `packages/observability-kit`
- Registry: `BOUNDARY_OWNERS.md` §Observability, `DOMAIN_ROLES.md` `observe` row
- Prior work: PR #157 Metron/metrickit, PR #158 Wave A map, PR #159 G2 chokepoint repoint, PR #161 Traceon status
- Build verification: `cargo check --workspace` PASS (2026-06-17)

| Phase | Scope | Acceptance |
|-------|-------|------------|

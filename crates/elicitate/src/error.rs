//! Typed errors for the elicitate crate.

/// All errors returned by the [`elicitate`](crate) library.

/// errors — they're surfaced as [`ElicitResponse::Cancelled`](crate::ElicitResponse::Cancelled)
/// and [`ElicitResponse::TimedOut`](crate::ElicitResponse::TimedOut)
/// respectively. Only failures that prevent the popup from running or
/// returning a meaningful response are errors.

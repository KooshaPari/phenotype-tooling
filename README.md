## What is this

**BytePort is a self-hosted IaC deployment + portfolio platform for developer projects.** Define one manifest (`odin.nvms`) at your repo root and BytePort provisions a MicroVM-backed deployment on your own cloud, registers the resulting endpoints with a portfolio site, and uses an LLM to generate showcase metadata for each project.

### Canonical stack

This README previously disagreed with itself. The actual shipping stack is:

- **Backend:** Go 1.25 — `backend/byteport` (Gin + GORM + SQLite, PASETO auth, AWS SDK)
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 + Tailwind 4, packaged as a **Tauri 2** desktop/mobile shell — `frontend/web`
- **MicroVM runtime:** Spin / `nvms` Go service — `backend/nvms`
- **Dev orchestration:** `./start dev` (tmux) and `./start prod` — see below
- **Persistence:** SQLite via GORM

The old Loco.rs / Rust / NanoVMS narrative is retired; the repo root is Go/SvelteKit/Tauri, not a Rust workspace.

### Running it

```sh
./start dev     # tmux session: SvelteKit dev (port 5173) + `air` hot-reload Go backend
./start prod    # builds the SvelteKit frontend, runs `npm start`, then `go run main.go`
```

`./start` requires `tmux` (dev mode), `npm`, and `go`. Edit the hardcoded paths inside `./start` if your checkout is not at `~/temp-PRODVERCEL/Rust/webApp/byte_port` — that path is a leftover from the original author's machine and will be parameterized in a follow-up.

### Credentials

Demo portfolio integration (Slickport) expects credentials you set yourself. **Do not** use any credential string copied from an older revision of this README; replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` placeholders with values from your own deployment.

## An IAC Deployment + UX Generation platform for Software Developer Portfolios
## With One IAC File Defining your Application Structured and related infra, Byteport deploys your project from your github repository onto your aws cloud platform, then utilizing chatgpt(soon llama) to then send object templates for additions to demonstration/portfolio sites to display and provide interaction access to these projects (and show them off automagically!)
### [Example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJeQOPHCNY1aHjXprNrmxMNi9hZaYSPW/view?usp=sharing)
### Refer to [Fixit-Go](https://github.com/kooshapari/fixit-go) [Chatta](https://github.com/kooshapari/chatta) For Project Examples, [Slickport](https://github.com/kooshapari/slickport) for Portfolio integration example
## Quickstart
### Prepwork:
- Install SpinCLI, golang etc
- Clone Project, open 3 terminals -> backendyteport -> spin build up, backend
vms -> go run main.go , frontend\web -> npm i -> npm run dev
- Grab Demosite and startup(if you don't want to setup api routes rn either remove the demonstrator call in the deploy function OR clone and run slickport with npm run dev and provide localhost:5180, <YOUR_API_KEY> for credentials)
- localhost:5173/signup -> signup -> first time setup -> home -> ready
### Deploy Prep
- Grab an application and in the root create a README.md, and an odin.nvms, follow pattern below:
NAME: app
DESCRIPTION: basic todo
SERVICES:
- NAME: "main" (REQUIRED - Points to url/, typically for frontend)
-   PATH: "./frontend"
-   PORT: 8080
-   ENV={hello=hi} (not tested)
- NAME: "backend""
-   PATH: "./backend"
-   PORT: 8081
- Readme will be fed as part of prompt to describe your project and add context, do a quick detailed bullet list etc
- map all API URLs in your program to /service/apiaction other than main which takes /*
- If too lazy refer to Chatta or Fixit-Go repos which are ready for byteport deployment
### Deploy
- Go to UI, pick repo, write name and descr(rest are useless atm) deploy, wait a bit (no user ui progress indication atm refer to spin instance in terminal), check portfolio and dashboard, instance now avail.

## Introduction

This manifesto outlines the development of **BytePort**, a cloud-based platform for deploying and managing applications using a custom-developed MicroVM technology called **NanoVMS**. The project leverages **SvelteKit** for the frontend and **Loco.rs** for the backend. BytePort aims to provide a Docker-like experience for deploying applications but uses lightweight virtual machines instead of containers, offering users greater control and isolation.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** BytePort - MicroVM Cloud Management and Portfolio Integration

**MicroVM Technology Name:** NanoVMS

**Description:**

BytePort is a cloud solution for deploying web applications and other projects directly from Git repositories. It creates and deploys pre-configured MicroVMs based on user specifications using the custom-developed **NanoVMS** technology. Upon successful deployment, BytePort integrates the project into the user's portfolio (e.g., `kooshapari.com`), adding project pages and linking the frontend of each web app to its respective project. Non-web app projects can also be deployed with custom configurations. Clients can view, debug, clone, and rebuild these instances as needed.

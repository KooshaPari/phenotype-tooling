## Stack

Primary language: **Python**

## Conventions

- Branches: `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*` off `main`.
- Commits: Conventional Commits preferred (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
- PRs: open ready-to-merge unless explicitly WIP. Squash-merge with branch deletion is the default.
- Quality gates: lint + test must pass locally before pushing. CI is currently billing-blocked; do not block on CI status.
